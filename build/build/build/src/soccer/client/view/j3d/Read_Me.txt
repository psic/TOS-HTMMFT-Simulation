Package 'soccer.client.view.j3d' is responsible for viewing the soccer game in 3D.
As it is, this package  is a stub. Class 'Field3D' is disabled by most of its code commented out - just to allow 
the rest of TOS compile normally. All the rest classes comprisig this package are removed.

The original Java files are located in directory 'TOS_2.2.0/3Dfiles'. They have been removed from this project because 
they require Java3D API that is tricky to set up, especially after the JRE is updated (which may happen several times a year). 
The 3D view of the soccer game is the only advantage that in the BIT Capstone Project course is not worth the effort. 
In other courses, however, it might be worthy.
