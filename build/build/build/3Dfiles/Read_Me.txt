This folder contains the original files comprising package 'soccer.client.view.j3d'. 
They are responsible for viewing of the soccer game in 3D.

In TOS, this package is standing out because it is using about ten Java packages that do not come with
the standard JDK. Rather, they belong to Java3D API that must be installed separately.

For the purpose of simplicity, this package has been moved out of TOS. By restoring the contents of
this package and adding the missing JavaD packages, it is possible to obtain the 3D view functionality.
